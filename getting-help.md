# Getting help in a shell

## `man` command

### Syntax:

- `man <tool>`

Example: `man curl`

After looking at some examples, we can also quickly look at the optional parameters without browsing through the complete documentation. We have several ways to do that.

- `<tool> --help/-h`

## `apropos` command

Each manual page has a short description available within it. This tool searches the descriptions for instances of a given keyword.

### Syntax:

- `apropos <keyword>`
